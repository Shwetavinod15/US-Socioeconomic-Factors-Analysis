# Socioeconomic Data Visualization Project (Texas, Florida, New York)

## 📊 Overview

This data visualization project investigates the impact of key socioeconomic variables across three U.S. states—Texas, Florida, and New York—using Tableau. It explores how factors such as education, poverty, wages, internet access, ethnicity, and GDP interact within various counties and Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs).

The project addresses questions around economic mobility, digital equity, institutional representation, and regional development through nine Tableau visualizations and dashboards.

## 📁 Files Included

- `DV_Project_SK.twbx`: Tableau Workbook with interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- `DV_Project_Report.docx`: Project documentation containing detailed analysis and interpretation of the visualizations.
- Dataset files:
  - `Annual_Wages_Per_Employee_Final.xlsx`
  - `Cost of Internet.csv`
  - `Datasets.xlsx`
  - `Education_Attainment.csv`
  - `Ethnicity and Race.csv`
  - `GDP.csv`
  - `poverty_Rate.csv`

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. How do education attainment rates correlate with poverty rates across counties?
2. How have poverty rates evolved from 2012 to 2022?
3. What does the poverty-education ratio reveal about socioeconomic disparities?
4. How does internet cost vary across cities, and what are its implications?
5. What does the GDP Chain Index reveal about regional economic trajectories?
6. How do poverty rate rankings evolve competitively over time by county?
7. How are Asian, Black, and White individuals represented across institutions?
8. How are annual wages per employee linked to education attainment?
9. How do average GDP and wages per employee reflect regional economic dynamics?

## 🛠 Methodology

Data for this project was sourced from:

- **U.S. Census Bureau** (Education Attainment, Poverty Rate)
- **Bureau of Economic Analysis** (GDP)
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics** (Annual Wages)
- **IPEDS** (Ethnicity in Institutions)
- **Numbeo** (Cost of Internet)

The Tableau workbook integrates these datasets to produce comparative visualizations across MSAs and counties.

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- **Scatterplots** of Education vs. Poverty
- **Animated Trends** of Poverty over Time (2012–2022)
- **Bar Charts** of GDP Chain Index and Wages
- **Drill-down Analyses** of Bachelor’s Degrees and Income by Region
- **Internet Cost Comparisons** by City
- **Representation Metrics** by Race and Institution

## 🧠 Insights

- Higher education levels generally correlate with lower poverty rates.
- Urban MSAs like New York and Miami show strong GDP and higher wages.
- Internet costs are lower in highly populated cities, impacting digital access.
- Ethnic representation varies greatly across institutions, offering insight into diversity and inclusion efforts.
- Williamson County (TX) consistently leads in educational and economic performance.

## 📌 Dashboards

- **Dashboard 1**: Economic & Social Overview (FL, TX, NY)
- **Dashboard 2**: Educational & Institutional Insights

## ✅ Conclusion

This project underscores the multifaceted nature of socio-economic disparity in the U.S. and highlights how data visualization can inform policy and strategy. It aims to support equitable development and targeted socioeconomic interventions.

## 📚 Future Work

- Study how internet affordability affects education and job access.
- Explore GDP and education as mediators of poverty reduction.
- Expand analysis to additional states or compare rural vs. urban trends nationwide.
